Sales Performance Analysis: End-to-End Data Pipeline
📋 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a full-scale data analysis workflow—from raw data ingestion and cleaning to executive-level visualization. Using a large-scale sales dataset across three relational tables, I acted as a Data Analyst to identify trends, optimize sales processes, and answer key business questions regarding profitability and customer behavior.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Database: SQL (Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Aggregation)

Visualization: Tableau (Interactive Dashboarding)

Documentation: GitHub (Version Control)

🗂️ Data Architecture
The project utilizes three core relational tables:

Orders Table: Transactional data (Order ID, Date, Product ID, Sales Amount).

Products Table: Metadata (Product Category, Sub-category, Cost).

Customers Table: Demographics and segment information.

🏗️ Phase 1: Data Cleaning & Exploration (SQL)
Because the dataset exceeded the capacity of standard spreadsheet tools, I utilized SQL for efficient processing.
