## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Database : postgreSQL (Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Aggregation) 

Visualization: Tableau (Interactive Dashboarding)

Documentation: GitHub (Version Control) & drow io 

## 🗂️ Data Architecture
The project utilizes three core relational tables:

Sales Table: Transactional data (sales ID, Date, Product ID, unit price , quantity ).

Products Table: Metadata (Product id, product name, Cost , supplier).

Inventory Table: store and location information .

🏗️ Phase 1: Data Cleaning & Exploration (SQL)
Because the dataset exceeded the capacity of standard spreadsheet tools, I utilized SQL for efficient processing.
